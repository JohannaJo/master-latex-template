It has been shown that the HORN algorithm can be used to learn rules represented in the description logic DL-Lite in polynomial time by the number of queries and the size of the queries. \cite{DL_lite} 

In the paper "Extracting Horn Theories with Queries and Counterexamples" \todo{Add source when \newline paper is published} Anlguin's HORN algorithm was used to query a trained neural network. The neural network had been trained on positive and negative examples of a Horn sentence and so the HORN algorithm was used as a form of neural network verification. If the output of the algorithm indeed matched the target HORN sentence, then one could verify that the neural network had a learnt a reliable representation of the Horn sentence.
