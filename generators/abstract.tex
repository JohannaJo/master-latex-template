\noindent Knowledge graphs (KGs) have risen in both size and use over the past few years, and there are a range of approaches for evaluating information in them. Symbolic approaches, such as rule based machine learning, offer an explainable way to determine the appropriateness of a new fact based on rules mined from the KG in question. Some of the most successful approaches for triple prediction in knowledge graphs are knowledge graph embeddings (KGE) that use neural reasoning. (cite a few goodies), however these lack the explainability of symbolic approaches. This thesis aims to see how the extension of a KG using KGEs affects the rules mined from the KG. This is done by first mining rules from an unaltered KG, and compare these rules with those mined from the KG extended with facts predicted to be true by the KGE. The experiments examine three different KGEs: TransE, DistMult and ComplEx...
